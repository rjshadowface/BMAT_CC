Overview

The BMAT (BA2 Merging Automation Tool) tool is a tool for automated merging of Fallout 4 BA2 files.

BMAT CC is a version of BMAT specialising in Creation Clug mods. It is a tool that is intended to take away most of the complexity from of the manual process of merging mods asset files like BA2 files by automating most of the process steps.

Note: BMAT does not merge mods plugins, so don't disable any of your mods after a BMAT merge!
